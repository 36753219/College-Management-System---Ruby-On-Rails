# College-Management-System---Ruby-On-Rails
School/College Management System 

This system is a very comprehensive system and was made with a clear view of Schools and College's functions in mind. It is built
using following technologies -

1. Ruby On Rails
2. Bootsrap (CSS/Javascript Framework)

These are the functions this system handles much better than any other system available (& Yes I mean it.)

1. Student
2. Faculty and Non Faculty
3. HR
4. Finance
5. Messaging (Both SMS and Email)
6. Bus
7. Hostel
8. Has Place for Biometric/RFID Cards and Access
9. Inventory Management
10. Online Exam
11. Exams and Its Results (Most Important)
12. Handles Marking, Grading as well as Pointers System
13. Attendance (Both Students and Management)
14. Activity Log and Personalised Dashboard For Every Individual
15. Class Room Activities, Complains and Remarks
16. Direct Interaction of Parents With Faculty and Can Track Student Performances and Remarks
17. And Many Many More...

I'll probably come up with the steps on how to get this started. I have stopped working on this system and I am no more selling 
it, so its better to make it public. If any one of you want to extend it more, Feel free to contact me here - prashantban@gmail.com

Will come up with installation instructions soon.

Cheers..!!!
